# log-in-system
This piece of code defines a class called User with a constructor method that takes a username and password as parameters and sets them as attributes of the User object.

There is also a function called login that takes a list of User objects, a username, and a password as parameters. It iterates through the list of users and checks if the username and password match any user in the list. If there is a match, it returns True, otherwise, it returns False. This code is essentially a simple authentication system.
